# Data Directory

This directory contains sample datasets for the agricultural yield prediction model.

## Sample Data

`sample_crop_data.csv` - A small anonymized dataset demonstrating the required format for the prediction model.

## Data Format

The model expects CSV files with the following columns:
- temperature_mean: Average temperature during growing season (Â°C)
- rainfall_total: Total rainfall during growing season (mm)
- soil_nitrogen: Nitrogen content in soil (ppm)
- soil_phosphorus: Phosphorus content in soil (ppm)
- soil_potassium: Potassium content in soil (ppm)
- humidity_mean: Average humidity during growing season (%)
- sunshine_hours: Total sunshine hours during growing season
- irrigation_amount: Applied irrigation water (mm)
- pest_severity: Pest infestation severity score (0-10)
- yield: Target variable - crop yield in tons/hectare

## Data Sources
